# Shape Matcher Vita
This application is a simple shape matching game developed for the PlayStation Vita. It uses augmented reality marker tracking to render shapes relative to the markers recognised my the Vita's camera.

This application was built using the Sony sample framework, and as a result, some code has been ommitted to comply with copyright protections. This application was also built using Grant Clarke's GEF Framework, which can be found [here](https://github.com/grantclarke-abertay/gef).

The code presented here is merely for demonstration purposes only and will not work in isolation for obvious reasons.
